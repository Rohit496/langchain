The first few decades after 1947 saw the Indian National Congress' (INC) near complete domination over the political map of India. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, took oath on 15 August 1947. Nehru went on to serve as prime minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four general elections in the process. His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death. After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, a former home minister and a leader of the Congress party, ascended to the position of prime minister. Shastri's tenure saw the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in Tashkent, after signing the Tashkent Declaration.\\nAfter Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, was elected as the country's third prime minister. The first, and to date, the only, woman to hold the post, Indira's first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as nationalisation of banks; end of allowances and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile princely states of the British Indian Empire.
